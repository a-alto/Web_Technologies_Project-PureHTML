# Web Technologies project - Pure HTML implementation

This is the project for the Web Technologies course at **Politecnico di Milano**.

The aim of this project is to design and develop a web application, focusing on the front-end and the back-end (as well as a little MySQL database schema).

For the thin-client solution (Pure HTML implementation), the following technologies were used:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Java (Java EE Servlets)
- Thymeleaf (Template Engine)
- SQL

More info about the specifications, the software design, and architecture (IFML schemas and other) can be found here: [documentation](Documentation/Catalogazione_di_immagini-Documentazione.pptx) (Italian only).
